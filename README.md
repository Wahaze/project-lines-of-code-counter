# project-lines-of-code-counter
This Python script recursively scans a project directory, ignoring folders like node_modules. It aggregates all text files into a single .txt file and generates a rich HTML report with overall project stats including total number of lines of code, a file size leaderboard, and the full content of each file for easy analysis and archiving.
